# HelloWorld

Hi everyone! This is my first time on GitHub. My name is Roman i'm 25 y.o. In the past i have experience with delphi, now i'm working on Java, JS and Python. In future i'm planning to learn swift or kotlin. My main wish is to become an android developer, because i really love portable devices.
